      <h3>Info</h3>
      <p>
        This website is made for players who love going for true 100% completion in Genshin Impact. Since the game doesn’t have all progress tracking in one place (like world quests or overworld chests), this tool will help you keep track of every world quest in the game (ofc archon quests, story quests and hangouts are not here because they are easily found in-game). It’s completely free to use and doesn’t require an account or login. All your progress is saved directly in your browser. The site is a solo project that I update myself using information from the Genshin Wiki. As a fellow 100% enjoyer, I wanted to make things easier for others who play the same way, and I hope that someday features like this will be added to the game itself. In the future, I might add more languages if anyone is willing to help with translations.
      </p>
      <h3>About Quests</h3>
      <p>
        Using the quest tracker is very simple. You just mark the quests you’ve already completed, and that’s it. No complicated setup or extra steps.
      </p>
      <p>
If you’re not sure whether you’ve done a specific quest on your account, you can usually check the Achievements menu in-game, since most world quests are tied to achievements. Mondstadt quests can be a bit trickier, but it’s still doable with some checking.
</p>
      <p>
If you need more details about a quest or want to verify where it comes from, you can also look it up on the Genshin Impact Wiki:
<a href="https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/World_Quest">World Quests</a>

      </p>
      <h3>About Chests</h3>
      <p>
        Using the chest tracker is also pretty straightforward. Go to the Chests section and look at the in-game Achievement category listed in each chest row.
  </p><p>
Then, open that same category in Genshin’s Achievements menu and find the achievement that shows your current chest count. Once you have the number, just enter it on the site, and you’re done.
  </p><p>
        <h4>DISCLAIMER:</h4> Chest counts may differ depending on when you started playing or exploring. Over multiple updates, Genshin had bugs where some chests did not count correctly, counted for the wrong region, or were only available during limited-time events. It's mostly for Mondstadt, Liyue and Inazuma I. Because of this, some players may never be able to reach the exact same maximum numbers as others. Specific achievements will have information on where the counter may vary. This is normal and not an issue with the tracker. You can also look it up on the Genshin Impact Wiki:
    <a href="https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Chest#Achievements_Counters">Chest Achievement Counters</a>
